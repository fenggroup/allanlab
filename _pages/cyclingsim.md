## Virtual reality (VR) cycling simulator

<div style="font-size: 17px">
We have developed a high-fidelity VR cycling simulator that could simulate cycling in an immersive virtual environment.

This simulator allows us to study driver-bicyclist interactions, cyclist behaviors and facility preferences, and among many other things in a safe, controlled, and replicable environment.

Technical details on the simulator development can be found in [Ayah Hamad's Master's thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.7302/1035).

### Walking in cyclists' shoe

<div style="font-size: 17px">
- A number of virtual scenarios of common dangerous encounters (e.g., close passes) by cyclists were developed.
- One can experience these encounters from a first-person, cyclist's perspective in our immersive VR simulator. 
- These scenarios were also converted to 360-degree videos and shared on YouTube, so that people anywhere can experience them on their own devices (computers, smartphones, tablets).
