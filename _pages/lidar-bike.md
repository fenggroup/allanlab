## Research bicycle with lidar

<div style="font-size: 17px">

We have developed a research bicycle outfitted with a lidar (Ouster OS-1 32-channel). 
Lidar is able to continuously measure the riding environment in point cloud data from a moving bicycle.

This lidar bicycle allows us to study driver-bicyclist interactions in real-world roadways with continuous and accurate distance measurements from the bicycle to any nearby objects (e.g., surrounding vehicles). 

<!-- FOR FUTURE: Describe why studying driver-bicyclist interaction can help us. -->
