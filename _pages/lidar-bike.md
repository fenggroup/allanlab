## Research bicycle with lidar

We have developed a research bicycle that is equipped with a lidar system (Ouster OS-1 32-channel) that is able to continuously record the riding environment in point cloud data from a moving bicycle.

This bicycle allows us to study driver-bicyclist interactions in real-world roadways with continuous and accurate distance measures from the bicycle to any nearby objects (e.g., surrounding vehicles).
