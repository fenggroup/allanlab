## Bike counter

<div style="font-size: 17px">

We use a bike counter ([Eco-Counter pneumatic tube counter](https://www.eco-counter.com/produits/tubes-en/tubes-2/)) that automatically records bicycle traffic data at a location.

This device allows studying the usages of various road/street infrastructures by people on bicycles.
